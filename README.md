How to use?
---

Backup your original `.vimrc` and `.vim` settings.

1. You'll need to be using a 256-color terminal. You can add ``export TERM='xterm-256color'`` to your `.bashrc`.
2. ``git clone https://github.com/pcchou/.vim.git && ln -s .vim/.vimrc`` in your home directory.
  * If you want to use powerline, you'll need to install powerline.
    1. ``pip install --user git+git://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline`` to install powerline.
    2. Download a powerline font, and put it in your `~/.fonts` to install it.
    3. Set your terminal to use it.
  * If you don't want to use powerline, please add a alias in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_aliases` (or whatever it is with your shell): ``alias vim='vim -u ~/.vim/npl.vimrc'`` to start vim with a different vimrc.
4. Open vim and wait for the plugins to install.
5. Use it and report any issue or suggestions.
